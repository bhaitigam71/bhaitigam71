I'm a <b>full-stack developer</b> with a passion for crafting user-friendly interfaces. Recently, I spearheaded the development of a new e-commerce platform that resulted in a 20% increase in conversions. I'm a strong believer in Agile development and love collaborating with cross-functional teams.

A highly motivated <b>full-stack developer</b> with 5+ years of experience. I have a deep understanding of both front-end frameworks like React and back-end languages like <b>Python</b>. In my free time, I enjoy building open-source projects and contributing to the developer community.
